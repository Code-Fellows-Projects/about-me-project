## About me guessing game

+ This page gives a user a small biography about me and asks them "yes" or "no" questions through prompts and alerts to tell them if they are correct or not.

+ Added a 6th and 7th question. One is a guessing the number of years ive lived in seattle and the other is using an array and having the user guess my favorite ice cream flavors.

+ Lastly I added an alert to tell the user how many questions they got wrong or right to show them how well they know me!

+ Applied what we learned today about functions and wrap each question in one

### Reflection

+ I used what we learned in class today to create if/else statements and created a quiz game using information in my biography.

+ We learned arrays and how to use them to have the user guess an answer but only give them x chances.

+ Today we learned best practices with peer programing which was a very helpful process to be able to understand if/else statements, loops and functions better.
